\chapter{Getting started}
This chapter will cover some of the most basic things that you need to 
understand in order to write some very simple SSL/TLS code. Let's start off with a
``Hello World'' client. It's purpose is simply to open up an SSL/TLS connection
to a remote server, send a simple message, and then close the connection. Don't
worry if you don't understand all of the individual steps yet, we will cover
them in the rest of this chapter.
